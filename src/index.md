# Usmu

Usmu is a next-generation static site generator built in Ruby and designed from the ground up
to be flexible and extensible but still easy to use.

Welcome to your new Usmu website! Feel free to look around and find out what's in store for you.

This is currently the test-bed for the usmu-github plugin. See
[usmu/usmu.github.io](https://github.com/usmu/usmu.github.io/) and
[usmu/usmu-github-pages](https://github.com/usmu/usmu-github-pages/) for more information.

## Real site coming soon!
